# Nurowerx Research Stack

### TRACE · LOOP · LENS · FRAME

**[Nurowerx Research Stack](https://github.com/Nurowerx/research-stack)** is public research software connecting evidence provenance, deterministic evaluation, scientific visualization and reviewed corrections through **TRACE · LOOP · LENS · FRAME**.

**[v0.1.0 — Initial Public Research Release](https://github.com/Nurowerx/research-stack/releases/tag/v0.1.0)** includes complete source, NRS-Bench, versioned synthetic datasets, three technical reports and reproduction instructions. **54 automated tests passed** (35 backend, 12 visualization, 7 browser); clean reproduction passed on Windows, Linux and macOS. The historical 31-test development baseline is preserved separately.

**Research scope:** Three seeds and 18 controlled synthetic executions; no real-model or human-user study, peer review or independent-party replication is claimed. Software is MIT; original datasets and papers are CC BY 4.0. Archival metadata is prepared; no DOI has been issued.

## Engineering and research contribution

The application connects dataset → evaluation → reviewed correction → rerun → report, preserving source records and prior outcomes. TRACE provides typed versioned relationships and validated graph exchange; LOOP records actual policy executions and review history; LENS links numerical marks to evidence; FRAME integrates inspection, annotations, saved layouts and report preview/export.

NRS-Bench uses original known-answer fixtures, deliberate invalid controls, paired full/affected comparisons and independent numerical chart oracles. Per 60-case development split, first-match scores 10/60, evidence-aware 60/60 and the reviewed prefer-latest full rerun 30/60. The selected affected case scores 1/1 and is reported separately. Repeated calls are not additional independent cases.

### Relationship to existing work

- [Epistemic Trust Lab](./EPISTEMIC-TRUST-LAB.md): read-only import reported verified. ETL's original 240 synthetic cases and 5,760 deterministic policy evaluations remain separate from the 31 Research Stack tests.
- [Resident Model Lab](https://github.com/Nurowerx/.github/blob/main/profile/research/RESIDENT-MODEL-LAB.md): potential future provenance and evaluation integration; **not confirmed implemented**.
- [VEYDRIS](./VEYDRIS.md): potential future data-provenance/analysis integration; **not confirmed implemented**.
